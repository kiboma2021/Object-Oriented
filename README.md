# Object-Oriented
JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language. But it still has ways of using object oriented programming (OOP).(It uses constructors)

A contructor is a class that constructs our objects.

The 'new' keyword:

- Creates a new empty object
- Sets the value of 'this' to the new object
- Calls the constuctor method
